## Bluetooth LE

[BLE Scout](https://github.com/eriklins/BLE-Scout)

Works okay for basic scanning, but has a bug where the screen flashes and button
clicking is tempermental when scanning is active. Allowed me to see the
advertised names and services of the devices as well as connect and read the
GATT services and characteristics.
